## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### Continued development

I'm planning to add some of these features later in this project:

- Put dot instead of numbers in die
- Show how much time did the user take to match the dice
- Save the best time and rolls on localStorage
